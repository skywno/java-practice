I studied three ways to join Strings: Using StringBuilder, Collectors.joining, and StringJoiner.
The fastest method was to use StringBuilder with for-loop; however, Collectors.joining reduces the lines of code.
Collectors.joining uses StringBuilder internally.
StringJoiner Uses String Array internally.
